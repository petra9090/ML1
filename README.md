# Hospitality Management

This analysis is based on a hotel booking demand dataset coming from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191?via%3Dihub#ab0010. 
Both hotels are located in Portugal: H1 at the resort region of Algarve and H2 at the city of Lisbon
We only used H2 for our analysis, respectively the city of Lisbon bookings.
The dataset contains 79,330 hotel booking records from a Lisbon city hotel, covering arrivals between July 2015 and August 2017,
including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled. 
Since this is hotel real data, 
all data elements pertaining hotel or custumer identification were deleted.
